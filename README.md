# ðŸŽ¤ Sentiment-Driven Multilingual Music Recommender ðŸŽ§

This application analyzes the sentiment and emotions in your text and recommends music that matches your mood. The model understands text in English, Russian, and Kazakh.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The recommendation process follows a few simple steps:

1. Emotion Analysis  
   You enter text describing your mood. A fine-tuned mBERT model processes the text to predict one or more associated emotions (e.g., *sadness*, *joy*, *admiration*).

2. Rule-Based Filtering  
   The system takes the primary emotion and uses a predefined set of rules to find songs with matching audio features (like *danceability*, *energy*, *valence*, etc.).

3. Curated Recommendations  
   To ensure quality, the app filters the matching songs, sorts them by popularity, and creates a candidate pool from the top 50 tracks.

4. Dynamic Output  
   It then shuffles this high-quality pool and presents 10 random recommendations, ensuring a fresh list every time you click submit.

5. Interactive Player  
   You can listen to the recommended tracks directly in the app using the embedded Spotify players.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

This project relies on two key datasets:

- Emotion Rules (EmotionWithFeatures.csv)  
  A custom-made dataset that maps specific emotions to ideal ranges for Spotify's audio features.
